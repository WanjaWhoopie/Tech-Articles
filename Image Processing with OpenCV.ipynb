    "The history of image processing dates back to the 1960s with people doing research at Bell Technologies, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Maryland, and a few other research facilities. In 1966 English molecular biologist Aaron Klug at the University of Cambridge formulated a method for digital image processing of two-dimensional images. In this article we will learn the basics of image processing with OpenCv. We shall assume that you know the basics of Python and have already installed it on your computer. \n",

The first is cv2.IMREAD_COLOR which species that the image should be read in color and any transparency is neglected. Instead of writing the whole word you can just use the number 1. The second is cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE which can be replaced by 0 and specifies that the image loaded should be in gray scale. The third one is cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED whose alternative is -1. It specifies to load an image as it is including its alpha channel. An alpha channel is essentially the component in color that defines opacity by determining how a pixel is rendere when blended with another. If you do not set up a flag the default is 1.  \n",
